Sub 250 gram, laterally stretched, top-mount battery freestyle quad/drone frame for indoor and outdoor use.  

As a laterally stretched frame, the width is grearter than the length.  The ratio is 1:1.24 for length:width respectivly.

Initial testing weight is 120-150grams AUW.

Suggested components and information:

* XXXX motors, XXXXkv
* 3s 450-650 mah
* HS 3045bn 2 blade and/or DYS 3045 three blade

Design Statement:

Imagine something flyable inside with larger spaces (big house, warehouse, commercial preoperty) or outdoors in mild wind.  Designed to support both "full size" components (flight controller, PDB, camera, etc) as well as the growing selection of micro components longevity of use is the goal. 

The top mount battery contributes to a full size feel on a very small package.  Stepping down the motor from 13xx or 14xx size shaves weight but keeps the performance high as long as the build is kept light and tight.

The PJ flies smooth and will allow an experienced pilot to find enough room, although tight, for components. To fly the PJ is to experience solid pep and recovery blended with a certain amount of casual and mellow flying.  We are very happy with the balance of power, size, and kenetic energy.  Undeniably sub-250 gram, with builds going as low as 120grams, this little bird is the perfect micro to put in the lunch box for those who care to burn a few with their sammy.

We have found that certain motor and prop combiations keep the noise level very low, much more quiet than the 4000kv and 3030 Tri blade combination we love on the [Moonshot 151](https://github.com/rotor-garage/moonshot).
